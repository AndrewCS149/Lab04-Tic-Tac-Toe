# Tic-Tac-Toe Application README
##### Lab04-Classes & Objects
##### Authors: Robert Carter, Andrew Smith, Kamit Satkeev


### Description

##### This is a C# console application that will allow two users (on the same terminal) to play a game of tic-tac-toe. The users can pick a number 1-9 that corresponds with a placement on the 3 x 3 board. Once a user has 3 (X's) or 3 (O's) in a row, column, or diagonal line, they are declared the winner, and the app stops.
